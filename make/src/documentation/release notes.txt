release notes
=============

1.0 beta (2004-06-12)
---------------------
- now runs only under Mac OS X 10.3+; 10.2 is no longer supported!

new features:
- the scanning process is now 3 times faster (thanks to Dave Payne from Apple)
- show the free space and the space occupied by not shown files (on the selected volume) and like a file in the treemap
- show physical (# of used clusters) or logical (size of content) file size
- ignore creator code (so all those PDF files are shown as "PDF File" and not as "Acrobat PDF File" or "PDF File")
- option to use a small font in the file list and the file kind statistic drawer
- refresh (reload) all or an individual file or folder
- preferences
- toolbar

The source code for the tree map is now a separate framework to be easily integrated into other applications.
